feat: Implement initial architecture document for RAGMaker v0.1.0

This commit introduces the foundational architecture document for the RAGMaker project,
detailing the core functionalities, command flows, and proposed technologies for version 0.1.0.

Key features outlined:
- `/rag` command for automated information gathering from web pages or GitHub repositories
  and RAG database construction.
- `/ask` command to initiate an interactive dialogue mode with the constructed RAG database.

Proposed technologies include:
- Python for core logic
- `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web crawling
- `GitPython` for GitHub repository handling (with sparse checkout for efficiency)
- `ChromaDB` as the Vector DB for rapid prototyping
- `LangChain` for text processing and LLM integration
- Gemini CLI for user interaction

This document serves as a clear guideline for future development, ensuring a consistent
and well-defined approach to building the RAGMaker application.
