feat: Implement RAG database construction and management process (v0.1.1)

This commit addresses the core business model of the RAGMaker project by implementing
the automated RAG database construction and management process.

Key changes include:
- Creation of `make_vector_db.py` to process text files from a specified directory,
  chunk them, vectorize them, and save them as a ChromaDB instance.
- Integration with `discovery.json` to register new RAG database entries, including
  path, title, and summary generated by an LLM.
- Addition of `.gemini/commands/ask.toml` and `.gemini/commands/rag.toml` for
  future command integration.
- Inclusion of `.tmp/discovery_sample.json` and `.tmp/tool_sample.py` as references.

This lays the groundwork for the RAGMaker application's core functionality,
allowing for the creation and management of vector databases from diverse data sources.
