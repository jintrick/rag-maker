Cache memory provides persistent file storage across workflow runs via GitHub Actions cache with 7-day retention. The compiler automatically configures the cache directory, restore/save operations, and progressive fallback keys at `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` (default) or `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory-{id}/` (additional caches).

## Enabling Cache Memory

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory: true
---
```

Stores files at `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` using a workflow-scoped cache key. Use standard file operations to store/retrieve JSON/YAML, text files, or subdirectories.

## Advanced Configuration

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: custom-memory-${{ github.repository_owner }}
    retention-days: 30  # 1-90 days, extends access beyond cache expiration
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".txt", ".md"]  # Restrict file types (default: empty/all files allowed)
---
```

> [!NOTE]
> Do not include `${{ github.run_id }}` in a user-supplied key — the compiler appends it automatically to the save key and generates stable restore-keys from the prefix.

### File Type Restrictions

The `allowed-extensions` field restricts which file types can be written to cache-memory. By default, all file types are allowed (empty array). When specified, only files with listed extensions can be stored.

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory:
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".jsonl", ".txt"]  # Only these extensions allowed
---
```

If files with disallowed extensions are found, the workflow will report validation failures.

## Multiple Configurations

```aw wrap
---
tools:
  cache-memory:
    - id: default
      key: memory-default
    - id: session
      key: memory-session-${{ github.run_id }}
    - id: logs
      retention-days: 7
---
```

Mounts at `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` (default) or `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory-{id}/`. The `id` determines the folder name; `key` defaults to a workflow-scoped prefix derived from the sanitized workflow name.

## Merging from Shared Workflows

```aw wrap
---
imports:
  - shared/mcp/server-memory.md

tools:
  cache-memory: true
---
```

Merge rules: **Single→Single** (local overrides), **Single→Multiple** (local converts to array), **Multiple→Multiple** (merge by `id`, local wins).

## Behavior

GitHub Actions cache: 7-day retention, 10GB per repo, LRU eviction. Add `retention-days` to upload artifacts (1-90 days) for extended access.

Caches are accessible across branches with unique per-run save keys. The compiler automatically generates a restore-keys prefix by stripping `${{ github.run_id }}` from the save key, so each run can fall back to the previous run's cache. For `scope: repo`, an additional restore key without the workflow ID is added to allow cross-workflow cache sharing.

Custom user-supplied keys auto-append `-${{ github.run_id }}` if not already present.

## Best Practices

Use descriptive file/directory names, hierarchical cache keys (`project-${{ github.repository_owner }}-${{ github.workflow }}`), and appropriate scope (workflow-specific default or repository/user-wide). Monitor growth within 10GB limit.

## Comparison with Repo Memory

| Feature | Cache Memory | Repo Memory |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Storage | GitHub Actions Cache | Git Branches |
| Retention | 7 days | Unlimited |
| Size Limit | 10GB/repo | Repository limits |
| Version Control | No | Yes |
| Performance | Fast | Slower |
| Best For | Temporary/sessions | Long-term/history |

For unlimited retention with version control, see [Repo Memory](/gh-aw/reference/repo-memory/).

## Automatic Cleanup

The [agentic maintenance](/gh-aw/reference/ephemerals/#cache-memory-cleanup) workflow automatically cleans up outdated cache-memory entries on a schedule. Caches are grouped by key prefix (everything before the run ID), and only the latest entry per group is kept. Older entries are deleted to prevent unbounded storage growth.

You can also trigger cleanup manually from the GitHub Actions UI by running the `Agentic Maintenance` workflow with the `clean_cache_memories` operation.

## Troubleshooting

- **Files not persisting**: Check cache key consistency and logs for restore/save messages.
- **File access issues**: Create subdirectories first, verify permissions, use absolute paths.
- **Cache size issues**: Track growth, clear periodically, or use time-based keys for auto-expiration.
- **Cache path misconfiguration**: When the agent calls `missing_data` with `reason: "cache_memory_miss"`, the conclusion handler automatically opens a failure issue flagging a likely cache path problem. Check that the agent prompt references the correct path (`/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` by default, or `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory-{id}/` for named caches) and that the cache key is consistent across runs.

## Integrity-Aware Caching

When a workflow uses `tools.github.min-integrity`, cache-memory automatically applies integrity-level isolation. Cache keys include the workflow's integrity level and a hash of the guard policy so that changing any policy field forces a cache miss.

The compiler generates git-backed branching steps around the agent. Before the agent runs, it checks out the matching integrity branch and merges down from all higher-integrity branches (higher integrity always wins conflicts). After the agent runs, changes are committed to that branch. The agent itself sees only plain files — the `.git/` directory rides along transparently in the Actions cache tarball.

### Merge semantics

| Run integrity | Sees data written by | Cannot see |
|---|---|---|
| `merged` | `merged` only | `approved`, `unapproved`, `none` |
| `approved` | `approved` + `merged` | `unapproved`, `none` |
| `unapproved` | `unapproved` + `approved` + `merged` | `none` |
| `none` | all levels | — |

This prevents a lower-integrity agent from poisoning data that a higher-integrity run would later read.

> [!NOTE]
> Existing caches will get a cache miss on first run after upgrading to a version that includes this feature — intentional, as legacy data has no integrity provenance.

## Security

Don't store sensitive data in cache memory. Cache memory follows repository permissions.

Logs access. With [threat detection](/gh-aw/reference/threat-detection/), cache saves only after validation succeeds (restore→modify→upload artifact→validate→save).
