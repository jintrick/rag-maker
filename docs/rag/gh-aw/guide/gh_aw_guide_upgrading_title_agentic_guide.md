title: Upgrading Agentic Workflows
description: Step-by-step guide to upgrade your repository to the latest version of agentic workflows, including updating extensions, applying codemods, compiling workflows, and validating changes.

This guide walks you through upgrading agentic workflows. `gh aw upgrade` handles the full process: updating the dispatcher agent file, migrating deprecated workflow syntax, and recompiling all workflows.

> [!TIP]
> Quick Upgrade
>
> For most users, upgrading is a single command:
>
> ```bash wrap
> gh aw upgrade
> ```
>
> This updates agent files, applies codemods, and compiles all workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading, ensure you have GitHub CLI (`gh`) v2.0.0+, the latest gh-aw extension, and a clean working directory in your Git repository. Verify with `gh --version`, `gh extension list | grep gh-aw`, and `git status`.

Create a backup branch before upgrading so you can recover if something goes wrong:

```bash wrap
git checkout -b backup-before-upgrade
git checkout -  # return to your previous branch
```

## Step 1: Upgrade the Extension

Upgrade the `gh aw` extension to get the latest features and codemods:

```bash wrap
gh extension upgrade gh-aw
gh aw upgrade --pre-releases    # Also consider newer pre-releases
```

Check your version with `gh aw version` and compare against the [latest release](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/releases). By default, `gh aw upgrade` follows stable releases; use `--pre-releases` to opt into pre-release builds, which are installed by exact tag. If you encounter issues, try a clean reinstall with `gh extension remove gh-aw` followed by `gh extension install github/gh-aw`.

## Step 2: Run the Upgrade Command

Run the upgrade command from your repository root:

```bash wrap
gh aw upgrade
```

This updates `.github/skills/agentic-workflows/SKILL.md` to the latest template, applies codemods to fix deprecated fields in all workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.md`), and recompiles all workflows to regenerate `.lock.yml` files. Use `--no-fix` to skip codemods and compilation, `-v` for verbose output, or `--dir` to target a custom workflows directory.

## Step 3: Review the Changes

Run `git diff .github/workflows/` to verify the changes. Typical migrations include `sandbox: false` → `sandbox.agent: false`, `app:` → `github-app:`, `safe-inputs:` → `mcp-scripts:`, `daily at` → `daily around`, and removal of deprecated `network.firewall` and `mcp-scripts.mode` fields.

## Step 4: Commit and Push

Stage and commit your changes:

```bash wrap
git add .github/workflows/ .github/skills/
git commit -m "Upgrade agentic workflows to latest version"
git push origin main
```

Always commit both `.md` and `.lock.yml` files together.

## Troubleshooting

**Extension upgrade fails:** Try a clean reinstall with `gh extension remove gh-aw && gh extension install github/gh-aw`.

**Codemods not applied:** Manually apply with `gh aw fix --write -v`.

**Compilation errors:** Review errors with `gh aw compile my-workflow --validate` and fix YAML syntax in source files.

**Workflows not running:** Verify `.lock.yml` files are committed, check status with `gh aw status`, and confirm secrets are valid with `gh aw secrets bootstrap`.

**Breaking changes:** Revert with `git checkout backup-before-upgrade` and review [release notes](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/releases).

## Advanced Topics

**Upgrading across versions:** Review the [changelog](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for cumulative changes when upgrading across multiple releases.

See the [troubleshooting guide](/gh-aw/troubleshooting/common-issues/) if you run into issues.
