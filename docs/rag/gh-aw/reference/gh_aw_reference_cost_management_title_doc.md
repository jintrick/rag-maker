title: Cost Management
description: Understand and control the cost of running GitHub Agentic Workflows, including Actions minutes, AI Credits (AIC) inference billing, and strategies to reduce spend.
sidebar:
  order: 296
---

The cost of running an agentic workflow is the sum of two components: **GitHub Actions minutes** consumed by the workflow jobs, and **inference costs** charged by the AI provider for each agent run.

## AI Credits (AIC)

**AI Credits (AIC)** are the primary metric for monitoring and budgeting inference costs in gh-aw. One AIC equals $0.01 USD. AIC values are computed from pricing data sourced from the [models.dev](https://models.dev/) catalog and appear in `gh aw logs`, `gh aw audit`, and run footer messages.

AIC is shown in the `gh aw logs` output table under the **AIC** column, in audit reports alongside raw token counts, and as `{ai_credits_suffix}` in workflow footer templates. For structured output, each run under `.runs[]` includes an `aic` field and each episode under `.episodes[]` includes `total_aic`.

> [!NOTE]
> AIC values are computed on a best-effort basis using pricing data sourced from the [models.dev](https://models.dev/) catalog and may not exactly match your provider's actual billing. Always verify charges in your provider's billing dashboard.

## Cost Components

### GitHub Actions Minutes

Every workflow job consumes Actions compute time billed at standard [GitHub Actions pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions). A typical agentic workflow run includes at least two jobs:

- **Pre-activation / detection** — Validates the trigger, runs membership checks, evaluates `skip-if-match` conditions (typical duration: 10–30 seconds)
- **Agent** — Runs the AI engine and executes tools (typical duration: 1–15 minutes)

Each job also incurs approximately 1.5 minutes of runner setup overhead on top of its execution time.

### Inference Costs

The agent job invokes an AI engine to process the prompt and call tools. Inference is billed by the provider based on the type of api token used.

## Monitoring Costs with `gh aw logs`

The `gh aw logs` command surfaces per-run metrics — elapsed duration, token usage, AIC (AI Credits), and turn count — before you decide what to optimize. Use `gh aw audit <run-id>` to deep-dive into a single run's token usage, tool calls, and inference spend; its **Metrics** and **Performance Metrics** sections cover token counts, AIC, turn counts, and estimated cost in one place. For cost trends across multiple runs, use `gh aw logs --format markdown [workflow]` to generate a cross-run report with anomaly detection.

### View recent run durations

```bash
# Overview table for all agentic workflows (last 10 runs)
gh aw logs

# Narrow to a single workflow
gh aw logs issue-triage-agent

# Last 30 days for Copilot workflows
gh aw logs --engine copilot --start-date -30d
```

The overview table includes a **Duration** column showing elapsed wall-clock time per run. Because GitHub Actions bills compute time by the minute (rounded up per job), duration is the primary indicator of Actions spend.

### Export metrics as JSON

Use `--json` to get structured output suitable for scripting or trend analysis:

```bash
# Write JSON to a file for further processing
gh aw logs --start-date -1w --json > /tmp/logs.json

# List per-run duration, tokens, and AIC across all workflows
gh aw logs --start-date -30d --json | \
  jq '.runs[] | {workflow: .workflow_name, duration: .duration, tokens: .token_usage, aic: .aic}'

# AIC spend grouped by workflow over the past 30 days
gh aw logs --start-date -30d --json | \
  jq '[.runs[]] | group_by(.workflow_name) |
  map({workflow: .[0].workflow_name, runs: length, total_aic: (map(.aic // 0) | add)})'
```

Each run under `.runs[]` includes `duration`, `token_usage`, `aic`, `workflow_name`, and `agent`. For orchestrated workflows, the same JSON includes deterministic lineage under `.episodes[]` and `.edges[]` — see the next section.

### Interpret Episode-Level Usage

`gh aw logs --json` emits three views of the same data: `.runs[]` (individual workflow runs), `.episodes[]` (related runs grouped into one logical execution — orchestrator, workers, `workflow_call` follow-ups, and reporting passes), and `.edges[]` (the inferred parent-child lineage). Use `.runs[]` to find which specific run was resource-heavy; use `.episodes[]` to answer "what did this job use end-to-end?". For non-orchestrated workflows, an episode collapses to a single run and the two views are equivalent.

Useful episode fields for usage analysis:

- **`total_runs`** — Workflow runs in the logical execution
- **`total_tokens`** — Raw token aggregate across grouped runs
- **`total_aic`** — Total AI Credits (AIC) for the episode; preferred cost metric
- **`total_duration`** — Wall-clock duration across grouped runs
- **`primary_workflow`** — Main workflow label
- **`resource_heavy_node_count`** — Runs flagged as resource-heavy
- **`blocked_request_count`** — Aggregate blocked-network pressure

For Claude, Codex, and Copilot runs, `total_aic` is the preferred cost metric — it reflects provider billing in AI Credits (1 AIC = $0.01 USD).

Safe-output actuation also appears in both `gh aw logs --json` (run- and repo-level) and `gh aw audit <run-id>` (under `safe_output_summary`). The relevant fields — `temporary_id_map_status`, `temporary_id_mappings`, `chained_target_count`, `chained_followup_action_count`, `delegated_temp_target_count`, `closed_temp_target_count`, and their repo-level aggregates — show how often a workflow follows up on its own outputs. When `temporary_id_map_status` is `missing` or `invalid`, chain counts fall back to `0` rather than guessing from incomplete data.

```bash
# Top 10 costliest logical executions over the past 30 days by AIC
gh aw logs --start-date -30d --json | \
  jq '[.episodes[] | {episode: .episode_id, workflow: .primary_workflow, runs: .total_runs, aic: (.total_aic // 0)}]
      | sort_by(.aic) | reverse | .[:10]'

# Top 10 heaviest Copilot executions by AIC
gh aw logs --start-date -30d --json | \
  jq '[.episodes[] | {episode: .episode_id, workflow: .primary_workflow, runs: .total_runs, aic: (.total_aic // 0)}]
      | sort_by(.aic) | reverse | .[:10]'
```

## Track Costs at Scale with OpenTelemetry

Use `observability.otlp` to stream run telemetry into a central
OpenTelemetry backend when one repository or one `gh aw logs`
report is no longer enough. This is the best fit for
organization-wide dashboards, alerting, and cross-repository cost
analysis.

```aw wrap
observability:
  otlp:
    endpoint: ${{ secrets.OTLP_ENDPOINT }}
    headers:
      Authorization: ${{ secrets.OTLP_TOKEN }}
```

The exported spans include workflow and model metadata such as
`gh-aw.engine.id`, `gen_ai.request.model`,
`gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, and
`gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`. Use these attributes to group usage
by workflow, engine, model, repository, or team in the backend of
your choice. For inference cost, AIC is derived from the raw
token counts in your observability backend using provider
pricing.

OpenTelemetry is most useful for answering questions such as:
"Which repositories are driving the most token usage?",
"Which model change caused a cost spike?", and
"Which workflows should be moved to a smaller model or stricter
trigger policy?" See the [OpenTelemetry guide](/gh-aw/guides/open-telemetry/)
for collector configuration and the [OpenTelemetry attribute reference](/gh-aw/reference/open-telemetry/)
for the emitted fields.

## Trigger Frequency and Cost Risk

The primary cost lever for most workflows is how often they run. Some events are inherently high-frequency:

#### High Risk

- **`push`** — Every commit to any matching branch fires the workflow
- **`check_run`**, **`check_suite`** — Can fire many times per push in busy repositories

#### Medium–High Risk

- **`pull_request`** — Fires on open, sync, re-open, label, and other subtypes
- **`issues`** — Fires on open, close, label, edit, and other subtypes

#### Medium Risk

- **`issue_comment`**, **`pull_request_review_comment`** — Scales with comment activity

#### Low / Predictable Risk

- **`schedule`** — Fires at a fixed cadence; easy to budget
- **`workflow_dispatch`** — Human-initiated; naturally rate-limited

> [!CAUTION]
> Attaching an agentic workflow to `push`, `check_run`, or `check_suite` in an active repository can generate hundreds of runs per day. Start with `schedule` or `workflow_dispatch` while evaluating cost, then move to event-based triggers with safeguards in place.

## Reducing Cost

### Use Deterministic Checks to Skip the Agent

The most effective cost reduction is skipping the agent job entirely when it is not needed. The `skip-if-match` and `skip-if-no-match` conditions run during the low-cost pre-activation job and cancel the workflow before the agent starts:

```aw wrap
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
  skip-if-match: 'label:duplicate OR label:wont-fix'
```

```aw wrap
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
  skip-if-no-match: 'label:needs-triage'
```

Use these to filter out noise before incurring inference costs. See [Triggers](/gh-aw/reference/triggers/) for the full syntax.

### Skip the Agent from Steps Using `noop`

When a condition is too complex for a GitHub search query — for example, when you need to call an API, inspect a file, or apply custom business logic — write a `noop` entry to `$GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS` from a `steps:` block. The harness checks for this entry before starting the AI engine and exits cleanly without incurring any AI Credits.

```aw wrap
steps:
  - name: Skip if no open issues exist
    run: |
      count=$(gh issue list --state open --json number --jq length)
      if [ "$count" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo '{"type":"noop","message":"No open issues to process"}' >> "$GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS"
      fi
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

When a `noop` entry is present at harness startup, the agent is never started and no AI Credits are charged. The `noop` message appears in the workflow conclusion comment or step summary. The same check also suppresses retries: if a `noop` is written during a failed run, the harness exits 0 instead of retrying.

Use `pre-agent-steps:` instead of `steps:` when the check must run right before the engine starts (for example, after MCP configuration is complete).

Compared to `skip-if-match` and `skip-if-no-match`:

#### `skip-if-match` / `skip-if-no-match`

- **Evaluated in:** Pre-activation job (earliest, cheapest)
- **Condition type:** GitHub search query
- **Actions minutes saved:** Yes — agent job is never scheduled
- **AI Credits saved:** Yes
- **Best for:** Simple label/status/title filters

#### `noop` in `steps:`

- **Evaluated in:** Agent job (after checkout and steps)
- **Condition type:** Arbitrary shell or script logic
- **Actions minutes saved:** No — agent job still runs through setup
- **AI Credits saved:** Yes
- **Best for:** Complex API calls or file-based conditions

For maximum savings, prefer `skip-if-match` / `skip-if-no-match` when possible. Reserve `noop` in `steps:` for conditions that require full scripting access or the agent job environment.

### Choose a Cheaper Model

The `engine.model` field selects the AI model. Smaller or faster models cost significantly less per token while still handling many routine tasks:

```aw wrap
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: gpt-4.1-mini
```

```aw wrap
engine:
  id: claude
  model: claude-haiku-4-5
```

Reserve frontier models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, etc.) for complex tasks. Use lighter models for triage, labeling, summarization, and other structured outputs.

### Limit Context Size

Inference cost scales with prompt size. Write focused prompts, avoid whole-file reads when only a few lines matter, cap result counts in tool calls, and use `imports` to compose a smaller subset of prompt sections at runtime.

### Prevent Runaway Costs from Agents

GitHub Agentic Workflows includes default guardrails to help prevent runaway agent costs:

- 20-minute timeout on the agentic step
- 1000 AI Credits per workflow run
- 5000 AI Credits per workflow per day (24-hour window)

These defaults can be overridden with frontmatter (`timeout-minutes`, `max-ai-credits`, `max-daily-ai-credits`) and enterprise environment variables (`GH_AW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`, `GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_AI_CREDITS`, `GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_DAILY_AI_CREDITS`).

### Cap AI Credits per Run

Use the top-level `max-ai-credits` frontmatter field to cap
the AI Credits (AIC) budget for a single workflow run. This
provides a hard stop for unusually expensive runs and a consistent
cost guardrail across all supported engines. The field accepts
plain integers or `K`/`M` suffixes such as `100M`.

```aw wrap
max-ai-credits: 500
```

When the budget is approached, gh-aw emits steering warnings before
the run reaches the limit. Set a negative value only when budget
enforcement must be disabled explicitly.

> [!NOTE]
> Threat-detection runs have their own AI Credits cap, separate
> from the main agent budget. See
> [Threat Detection → Detection Budget](/gh-aw/reference/threat-detection/#detection-budget)
> for `safe-outputs.threat-detection.max-ai-credits` (defaults to
> `400`, overridable via `GH_AW_DEFAULT_DETECTION_MAX_AI_CREDITS`).

### Cap Turns per Run

Use the top-level `max-turns` frontmatter field to cap the number
of chat iterations (model responses and tool calls) for a single
workflow run. Each additional turn consumes more tokens and Actions
compute time, so a turn limit bounds both runaway loops and cost.

```aw wrap
max-turns: 20
```

`max-turns` is supported across Claude, Codex, Copilot, and
Antigravity engines. When set, gh-aw exports the compiled value as
`GH_AW_MAX_TURNS` for the engine runtime — you do not need to set
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_TURNS` or an equivalent variable separately.

The field accepts integer literals or GitHub Actions expressions,
making it composable with `workflow_call` inputs:

```aw wrap
max-turns: ${{ inputs.max-turns || 15 }}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `engine.max-turns` is a deprecated alias for the top-level field
> and continues to compile for backward compatibility. Use
> `gh aw fix engine-max-turns-to-top-level` to migrate existing
> workflows automatically.

An enterprise-wide default can be set via the compiler process
environment variable `GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS`. Individual
workflows override this default by setting `max-turns` in
frontmatter.

### Cap Daily AI Credits per Workflow

Use `max-daily-ai-credits` to set a 24-hour AI Credits
cap for one workflow. The guardrail sums runs from the past 24 hours of the same
workflow across the repository, regardless of who triggered them.

```aw wrap
max-daily-ai-credits: 15M
```

You can also configure the same threshold via environment variable
to make the guardrail configurable per environment or workflow call:

```aw wrap
env:
  GH_AW_MAX_DAILY_AI_CREDITS: ${{ vars.AWF_DAILY_ET_LIMIT }}
```

When the total from the past 24 hours already meets or exceeds this threshold, the activation
job warns, creates an issue, skips the agent job, and lets the
conclusion job report the failure context.

The guardrail is disabled by default when omitted. Set `-1` to disable
it explicitly. Positive values accept plain integers or `K`/`M`
suffixes such as `100M`.

> [!NOTE]
> The daily guardrail is skipped for `workflow_call`,
> `repository_dispatch`, and `workflow_dispatch` runs carrying internal
> `aw_context` dispatch metadata.

### Roll out org/repo defaults with enterprise controls

For large installations, set baseline model and token guardrails
once, then let individual workflows override only when needed:

1. Export current defaults:

```bash
gh aw env get defaults.yml --scope org --org MY_ORG
```

2. Update and apply shared defaults in batch:

```yaml
default_max_ai_credits: "5M"
default_max_daily_ai_credits: "15M"
default_model_copilot: "gpt-5-mini"
default_model_claude: "claude-haiku-4-5"
default_model_codex: "gpt-5.4-mini"
```

```bash
gh aw env update defaults.yml --scope org --org MY_ORG
```

`gh aw env update` shows a confirmation preview before applying changes.
Pass `--yes` to skip the prompt in automation, or `--dry-run` to preview
without changing any variables. Set a field to `null` to delete the
corresponding variable from the target scope. Unknown YAML keys are rejected,
`default_max_turns` / `default_timeout_minutes` must be positive integers,
and `default_max_ai_credits` / `default_max_daily_ai_credits` must be
non-zero integers (a negative value disables the corresponding guardrail).

3. If you compile workflows in CI, pass compiler-read defaults into
the compiler process environment (for example via `${{ vars.* }}`):
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_AI_CREDITS`,
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_DAILY_AI_CREDITS`,
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS`,
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`,
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_DETECTION_MODEL`.

> [!TIP]
> `GH_AW_DEFAULT_MODEL_*` values are resolved at workflow runtime via
> `${{ vars.* }}` in compiled YAML, while timeout/max-turns/token
> defaults are read by the compiler process at compile time.

### Rate Limiting and Concurrency

Use `user-rate-limit` to cap how many times a user can trigger the workflow in a given window, and rely on concurrency controls to serialize runs rather than letting them pile up:

```aw wrap
user-rate-limit:
  max-runs-per-window: 3
  window: 60  # 3 runs per hour per user
```

See [Rate Limiting Controls](/gh-aw/reference/rate-limiting-controls/) and [Concurrency](/gh-aw/reference/concurrency/) for details.

### Use Schedules for Predictable Budgets

Scheduled workflows fire at a fixed cadence, making cost easy to estimate and cap. The less often a workflow runs, the lower the cost:

```aw wrap
# Once per day on weekdays — 5 runs/week
schedule: daily on weekdays
```

```aw wrap
# Every two days — roughly 15 runs/month
schedule: every 2 days
```

```aw wrap
# Weekly on Monday mornings — 4–5 runs/month
schedule: weekly
```

When an event-based trigger fires far more often than the agent actually needs to act, a schedule is almost always cheaper. Replace `push` or `issues` triggers with a daily or weekly schedule and let the agent work through a backlog of items in one run.

See [Schedule Syntax](/gh-aw/reference/schedule-syntax/) for the full fuzzy schedule syntax.

### Batch Instead of Reacting to Events

Reactive triggers like `issues` or `pull_request` launch one agent run per event. When many events arrive in a short window, that adds up quickly. A scheduled batch run groups all pending items into a single invocation — and because the shared system prompt and instructions are sent once for the whole batch, AI providers can cache that context across items, further reducing AI Credits consumption.

```aw wrap
description: Nightly issue triage (replaces reactive issues trigger)
on:
  schedule: daily
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  issues: read
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: gpt-4.1-mini
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]
---

Fetch all issues opened in the past 24 hours with no labels.
For each issue, apply the most appropriate label. Process them in a single pass.
```

> [!TIP]
> For high-volume repositories, combine a scheduled trigger with [BatchOps](/gh-aw/patterns/batch-ops/) to split work across parallel matrix jobs and stay within per-run token budgets.

### Use Inline Sub-Agents with Smaller Models

When a workflow delegates specialized tasks to sub-agents, each sub-agent can use a different model. Assign cheap, fast models to high-frequency sub-tasks (summarization, labeling, classification) and reserve frontier models only for the orchestrator.

```aw wrap
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: small
permissions:
  pull-requests: read

---

Use the `summarizer` sub-agent to summarize the diff, then post the result as a review comment.

## agent: `summarizer`
---
model: small
description: Summarizes a pull request diff in one paragraph
---
Read the diff and return a single paragraph describing what changed and why.
```

See [Inline Sub-Agents](/gh-aw/reference/inline-sub-agents/) for the full syntax.

### Use Inline Skills to Reduce Context

Move large instruction blocks out of the main prompt body using inline skills. At runtime, each `## skill:` block is extracted and written to engine-specific skill locations — the agent can invoke the skill on demand instead of receiving the guidance upfront, keeping the ambient context slim:

```aw wrap
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: small
permissions:
  issues: read
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]

---

Triage the issue using the `triage-rules` skill.

## skill: `triage-rules`
---
description: Classify issues and suggest next actions.
---
Classify by bug / feature / question, identify missing information, and suggest
the smallest actionable next step.
```

> [!TIP]
> Include the `agentic-workflows` tool only in workflows that need self-inspection. Omitting it from unrelated workflows eliminates several hundred tokens of ambient context per run.

## Agentic Cost Optimization

The `agentic-workflows` MCP tool exposes the same operations as the CLI (`logs`, `audit`, `status`) to any workflow agent, so a scheduled meta-agent can inspect and optimize other agentic workflows automatically — fetching aggregate cost data, deep-diving into individual runs, and proposing frontmatter changes (cheaper model, tighter `skip-if-match`, lower `user-rate-limit`) via a pull request.

```aw wrap
description: Weekly Actions minutes cost report
on: weekly
permissions:
  actions: read
engine: copilot
tools:
  agentic-workflows:
```

### What to Optimize Automatically

- **High AIC per run (Claude/Codex)** — Switch to a smaller model (`gpt-4.1-mini`, `claude-haiku-4-5`)
- **High AIC per run (Copilot)** — Switch to a smaller model or reduce context size
- **High turn count per run** — Set `max-turns` to cap iterations and prevent runaway loops
- **Frequent runs with no safe-output produced** — Add or tighten `skip-if-match`
- **Long queue times due to concurrency** — Lower `user-rate-limit.max-runs-per-window` or add a `concurrency` group
- **Workflow running too often** — Change trigger to `schedule` or add `workflow_dispatch`

> [!NOTE]
> The `agentic-workflows` tool requires `actions: read` permission and is configured under the `tools:` frontmatter key. See [GH-AW as an MCP Server](/gh-aw/reference/gh-aw-as-mcp-server/) for available operations.

## Optimize at Scale with github/agentic-ops

The [githubnext/agentic-ops](https://github.com/githubnext/agentic-ops) repository is the reference implementation for organization-wide agentic workflow monitoring and optimization. It applies the [MonitorOps](/gh-aw/patterns/monitor-ops/) pattern to summarize spend, escalate failures, and propose workflow improvements on a schedule.

## Common Scenario Estimates

These are rough estimates to help with budgeting. Actual costs vary by prompt size, tool usage, model, and provider pricing.

#### Weekly digest (schedule, 1 repo)

- **Frequency:** 4×/month
- **Actions minutes/month:** ~1 min
- **Inference/month:** Varies by model and prompt size

#### Issue triage (issues opened, 20/month)

- **Frequency:** 20×/month
- **Actions minutes/month:** ~10 min
- **Inference/month:** Varies by model and prompt size

#### PR review on every push (busy repo, 100 pushes/month)

- **Frequency:** 100×/month
- **Actions minutes/month:** ~100 min
- **Inference/month:** Varies by model and prompt size

#### On-demand via slash command

- **Frequency:** User-controlled
- **Actions minutes/month:** Varies
- **Inference/month:** Varies

> [!TIP]
> Create separate `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` service accounts per repository or team to attribute spend by workflow.
